The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.[5] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube.[6][7] The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹475 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.[8] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US$160 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.[9]

There have been twelve seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the Mumbai Indians, who won the 2019 season.[10] The venue for the 2020 season has been moved, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; games are now taking place in the United Arab Emirates from 19 September through 10 November 2020.[11][12]
